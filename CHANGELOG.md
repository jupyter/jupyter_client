### Summary

The 7.0 release brings a major feature in [Kernel Provisioners](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/blob/master/docs/provisioning.rst), which enable the ability for third parties to manage the lifecycle of a kernel's runtime environment.

Being a major release, there are some backward incompatible changes. Please see the [migration guide](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html) for further details.

## 6.2.0

- Yanked (PyPI) and marked as broken (conda)

## 6.1.13

- Yanked (PyPI) and marked as broken (conda)

## 6.1.12

- Shutdown request sequence has been modified to be more graceful, it
  now is preceded by interrupt, and will also send a `SIGTERM` before
  forcibly killing the kernel. [#620](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/620)
- Removal of `ipython_genutils` as a dependency. It was implicit
  before; but required by at least traitlets thus avoiding issues. We
  are working on completely removing it from all jupyter dependencies;
  as it might lead to issues packaging for Python 3.10, and was mostly
  used for compatibility with python 2. ([#620](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/620), [#605](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/605))
- Address a race condition between `shutdown_kernel` and restarter.

## 6.0.0

The git history had to be reworked heavily in merging 5.x and master, so
a link to all the changes at once in github had been left out as it's
just confusing.

An exciting change in this release is some async support (huge thanks to
@davidbrochart for doing most of the work)! See linked PR below for
more details, we're working on integrating this into nbclient as well
in the near future.

New Features:

- Session.msg_id optimization [#493](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/493)
- Only cache ports if the cache_ports flag is set to True
  [#492](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/492)
- Removed direct dependency on pywin32 as this is now in jupyter core
  [#489](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/489)

Fixes:

- Prevent two kernels to have the same ports [#490](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/490)

Docs:

## 5.2.1

[5.2.1 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/5.2.1)

- Add parenthesis to conditional pytest requirement to work around a
  bug in the `wheel` package, that generate a `.whl` which otherwise
  always depends on `pytest` see [#324](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/324)and [#325](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/325).

## 5.2

[5.2 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/5.2)

- Define Jupyter protocol version 5.3:
  - Kernels can now opt to be interrupted by a message sent on the
    control channel instead of a system signal. See
    `kernelspecs` and
    `msging_interrupt`
    [#294](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/294).
- New `jupyter kernel` command to launch an installed kernel by name
  [#240](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/240).
- Kernelspecs where the command starts with e.g. `python3` or
  `python3.6`---matching the version `jupyter_client` is running
  on---are now launched with the same Python executable as the
  launching process [#306](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/306). This
  extends the special handling of `python` added in 5.0.
- Command line arguments specified by a kernelspec can now include
  `{resource_dir}`, which will be substituted with the kernelspec
  resource directory path when the kernel is launched
  [#289](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/289).
- Kernelspecs now have an optional `metadata` field to hold arbitrary
  metadata about kernels---see `kernelspecs` [#274](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/274).
- Make the `KernelRestarter` class used by a `KernelManager`
  configurable [#290](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/290).
- When killing a kernel on Unix, kill its process group
  [#314](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/314).
- If a kernel dies soon after starting, reassign random ports before
  restarting it, in case one of the previously chosen ports has been
  bound by another process [#279](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/279).
- Avoid unnecessary filesystem operations when finding a kernelspec
  with `.KernelSpecManager.get_kernel_spec` [#311](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/311).
- `.KernelSpecManager.get_all_specs`
  will no longer raise an exception on encountering an invalid
  `kernel.json` file. It will raise a warning and continue
  [#310](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/310).
- Check for non-contiguous buffers before trying to send them through
  ZMQ [#258](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/258).
- Compatibility with upcoming Tornado version 5.0
  [#304](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/304).
- Simplify setup code by always using setuptools
  [#284](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/284).
- Soften warnings when setting the sticky bit on runtime files fails
  [#286](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/286).
- Various corrections and improvements to documentation.

## 5.1

[5.1 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/5.1)

- Define Jupyter protocol version 5.2, resolving ambiguity of
  `cursor_pos` field in the presence of unicode surrogate pairs.

  ::: {.seealso}
  `cursor_pos_unicode_note`
  :::

- Add `Session.clone` for making a copy
  of a Session object without sharing the digest history. Reusing a
  single Session object to connect multiple sockets to the same IOPub
  peer can cause digest collisions.

- Avoid global references preventing garbage collection of background
  threads.

## 5.0

### 5.0.1

[5.0.1 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/5.0.1)

- Update internal protocol version number to 5.1, which should have
  been done in 5.0.0.

### 5.0.0

[5.0.0 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/5.0)

New features:

- Implement Jupyter protocol version 5.1.

- Introduce `jupyter run` command
  for running scripts with a kernel, for instance:

  ```
  jupyter run --kernel python3 myscript.py
  ```

- New method
  `.BlockingKernelClient.execute_interactive` for running code and capturing or redisplaying its
  output.

- New `KernelManager.shutdown_wait_time` configurable for adjusting
  the time for a kernel manager to wait after politely requesting
  shutdown before it resorts to forceful termination.

Fixes:

- Set sticky bit on connection-file directory to avoid getting cleaned
  up.
- `jupyter_client.launcher.launch_kernel` passes through additional options to the underlying
  Popen, matching `KernelManager.start_kernel`.
- Check types of `buffers` argument in
  `.Session.send`, so that TypeErrors
  are raised immediately, rather than in the eventloop.

Changes:

- In kernelspecs, if the executable is the string `python` (as opposed
  to an absolute path), `sys.executable` will be used rather than
  resolving `python` on PATH. This should enable Python-based kernels
  to install kernelspecs as part of wheels.
- kernelspec names are now validated. They should only include ascii
  letters and numbers, plus period, hyphen, and underscore.

Backward-incompatible changes:

- :py`.datetime` objects returned in
  parsed messages are now always timezone-aware. Timestamps in
  messages without timezone info are interpreted as the local
  timezone, as this was the behavior in earlier versions.

## 4.4

### 4.4.0

[4.4 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.4)

- Add `.KernelClient.load_connection_info` on KernelClient, etc. for loading connection info
  directly from a dict, not just from files.
- Include parent headers when adapting messages from older protocol
  implementations (treats parent headers the same as headers).
- Compatibility fixes in tests for recent changes in ipykernel.

## 4.3

### 4.3.0

[4.3 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.3)

- Adds `--sys-prefix` argument to
  `jupyter kernelspec install`, for
  better symmetry with `jupyter nbextension install`, etc.

## 4.2

### 4.2.2

[4.2.2 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.2.2)

- Another fix for the `start_new_kernel` issue in 4.2.1 affecting slow-starting kernels.

### 4.2.1

[4.2.1 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.2.1)

- Fix regression in 4.2 causing `start_new_kernel` to fail while waiting for kernels to become available.

### 4.2.0

[4.2.0 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.2)

- added `jupyter kernelspec remove`
  for removing kernelspecs
- allow specifying the environment for kernel processes via the `env`
  argument
- added `name` field to connection files identifying the kernelspec
  name, so that consumers of connection files (alternate frontends)
  can identify the kernelspec in use
- added `KernelSpecManager.get_all_specs` for getting all kernelspecs more efficiently
- various improvements to error messages and documentation

## 4.1

### 4.1.0

[4.1.0 on
GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/milestones/4.1)

Highlights:

- Setuptools fixes for `jupyter kernelspec`
- `jupyter kernelspec list` includes paths
- add `KernelManager.blocking_client`
- provisional implementation of `comm_info` requests from upcoming 5.1
  release of the protocol

## 4.0

The first release of Jupyter Client as its own package.
